<h1>Why I miss Windows XP</h1>
Windows XP has been a meme for many years now, but, why did
Microsoft get rid of such a great operating system? Well,
According to the 'Net, it was terrible.. By today's terrible
standards. The way we look at things now is different, back
then, 45GB Hard drives were "Impossible to fill!" and now,
I don't see you fitting Grand Theft Auto 5 on there, let alone
a managable computer. The point is, times have changed, people,
have changed, COMPUTERS HAVE CHANGED, but looking back at it,
XP wasn't all that bad, it just faded away because of how
society sees things.

Plus, it had Minesweeper. And Bonzi Buddy, so... your choice.
